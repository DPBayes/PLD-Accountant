    - support for eps,delta computations with varying parameters (docs, tests, code quality)
    - added experimental computations for discrete mechanisms (in `fourier_accountant.experimental`)
    - added experimental computations for tight upper/lower for subsampled Gaussian mechanism (in `fourier_accountant.experimental`)
    - introduced PLD class structure for subsampled Gaussian and discrete mechanisms
    - introduced routines to compute bounds on privacy parameters given a PLD instance

# 0.12.0
